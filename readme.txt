The aim is to create a CRUD application TODO list.

V1.0 : -> Current
Read & Write tasks from the app (based on due_date, user, title)

V2.0 :
- Read all tasks due before a certain date : OK
- Modify operation : OK, not tested when several tasks found
- Delete operation : OK, not tested when several tasks found

Future implementations :
- user collection that can be linked with tasks collection
- authentication
- roles :
- add states of a tasks : TO BE DONE ; TO BE REVIEWED ; DONE
- add task workflow
